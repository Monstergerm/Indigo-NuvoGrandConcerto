# About the Nuvo Grand Concerto(16) Plugin

This plugin was intitially developed by Jeremy Swancoat.

It then received a major upgrade by Jeremy with v2.x, which included support for subscribing to a metadata broadcast from the Shairport Sync plugin.

It was subsequently modified by Monstergerm starting with v2022.x

Modified by Monstergerm for 16 Nuvo zones and iTunes Server as possible Music source.

Various code refinements, including support for ASCII 0-255 for correct display on keypads and in variables.

Added support for control of iTunes from Nuvo Keypads.

Added support for using Indigo with Nuvo via iTunes plugin or iTunes Local Control plugin.

Updated logging system.

Added custom state icons for Indigo UI.

Added many additional commands to control Nuvo GC system.

Added support for display of all metadata info from iTunes (including track info) on Nuvo Keypads.

Added writing track info to Indigo variables for use on control pages or triggers.

This plugin benefits from iTunes plugin (for getting some metadata) and iTunes Local Control plugin (for getting playlist name and track info).

This plugin should continue working after iTunes plugin is deprecated using a combination of iTunes Local Control and Airfoil Pro.

This plugin is compatible with Python 2.7 (ServerAPI 2.0) and Python 3.10 (ServerAPI 3.0) and requires Indigo 2022.x and higher in its default configuration for Python 3 (ServerAPI 3.0).
